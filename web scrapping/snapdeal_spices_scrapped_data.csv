HOW IT IS MADE- Amchur is made from green mangos that are thinly sliced and left to dry in the hot sun. Then they are ground into a powder and used as a spice or tonic to aid in digestion. It is sold in Indian stores but can also be purchased online. COOKING WITH AMCHUR- Dried mango powder is a souring agent so it can be used to flavor braises, stews, soups and vegetable dishes. It is especially delicious when combined with green vegetables like okra, potatoes, stewed lentils and chutneys. It'd be a great way to add a little zing to chili and other dishes that benefit from a dash of citrus. Wheats great is that this spice also tenderizes meat so you can add it to your favorite marinades. A little goes a long way so start with half a teaspoon and taste before adding more.

							Glutamates or Ajinomoto is a salt widely used in Chinese cuisine to enhance flavors, hence popularly called the 'flavor enhancer'. It can be used in a wide variety of industries including: food production, beverage, and various other industries. Glutamates occur naturally in protein foods such as meat, fish, poultry, and vegetables. Free glutamates are found in foods like tomatoes, tomato paste, cheese, and mushrooms. So, many natural foods which we add to dishes to make them tasty are high in free glutamate. Glutamates are added to food to enhance its flavour. They are added in the form of MSG in vegetable protein, yeast extracts, flavors and fermented soy products such as soy sauce. Common foods that can contain added MSG include savoury foods such as stocks, seasonings, soup, sauces and savoury snacks/meals.",Vegetarian,,,Ajinomoto,Gluten Free

							Dry mango powder is also known as an amchur powder in India, is a wonderfully aromatic spice that can be used to perk up a variety of dishes. Pale in color and with a tart yet fruity flavor, amchur (also spelled as amchoor) is an easy way to add a touch of acidity to dishes when you donâ€t have a lemon on hand. HOW IT IS MADE- Amchur is made from green mangos that are thinly sliced and left to dry in the hot sun. Then they are ground into a powder and used as a spice or tonic to aid in digestion. It is sold in Indian stores but can also be purchased online. COOKING WITH AMCHUR- Dried mango powder is a souring agent so it can be used to flavor braises, stews, soups and vegetable dishes. It is especially delicious when combined with green vegetables like okra, potatoes, stewed lentils and chutneys. It'd be a great way to add a little zing to chili and other dishes that benefit from a dash of citrus. Whatâ€s great is that this spice also tenderizes meat so you can add it to your favorite marinades. A little goes a long way so start with half a teaspoon and taste before adding more. RECIPES WITH AMCHUR- Amchur is commonly used in Northern Indian dishes such as pakoras, fried vegetable dumplings dipped in a spicy chickpea batter.",Vegetarian,,,Amchur,Gluten Free
